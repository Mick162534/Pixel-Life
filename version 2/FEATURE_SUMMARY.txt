Ecosystem Simulation â€“ Available Functionality

1. Creature System:
   - Unique ID, position, age, stats (strength, charisma, intelligence, agility, endurance, social_drive), energy, hunger.
   - Traits-based behavior: herbivore, carnivore, warrior, builder, gatherer, alpha, leader, curious, expansionist, herder.

2. Environment:
   - Harvestable ResourceNode (trees) and BushNode (berries) with regrowth logic.
   - ResourceManager for node management.

3. Resource Loop:
   - Gatherers harvest resources and deliver to StorageHut.
   - Builders withdraw wood from StorageHut for construction.

4. Buildings:
   - LoggingCamp, Farm, ConstructionYard, TamingPen, Watchtower, ResearchHut, StorageHut, Housing.
   - ConstructionManager handles build queue and progress.
   - Building prerequisites and per-tick behavior.

5. Research System:
   - ResearchHut generates points; ResearchManager unlocks tech with weighted randomness influenced by traits and conditions.

6. Tribes and Diplomacy:
   - Tribe class: tracks members, territory_chunks, relationships, research, walls (via WallManager), population cap (via Housing).
   - Diplomacy states: neutral, hostile, allied.
   - Affinity and tribe formation: affinity_system and tribe_creator modules.

7. Raid Bands:
   - Band and RaidFSM coordinate warrior raids: traveling, attacking, returning.

8. Housing & Population:
   - Housing buildings contribute to population cap; tribes enforce cap before breeding.

9. Affinity & Tribe Creation:
   - calculate_affinity and update_all_affinities compute mutual affinities.
   - form_tribes dynamically groups creatures into tribes based on affinity.

10. World Tick Loop:
    - world.tick: resource_manager.tick, bush.tick, form_tribes, tribe.tick, band.tick, creature.tick, construction_manager.tick, cleanup_unused_walls.

11. Terrain and Rendering:
   - TerrainGenerator creates grass, shallow water, deep water and tree tiles.
   - Deep water is dark blue and impassable without the "swimming" trait.
   - Shallow water is light blue and slows non-swimmers.
   - SimRenderer and MapRenderer draw terrain using these colors. Trees

     render as brown squares.
   - When no image assets are present, SimRenderer generates colored placeholders
     for buildings and creature species.
   - Spawn menu (toggle with `n`) lets you spawn gatherers, builders and wildlife
    such as deer, boar, goat, bear and fish. Hold Shift while confirming to
    spawn five at once.
12. Time Controls and Graph Tab:
    - Press Space to pause/unpause the simulation and +/- to change speed.
    - TAB switches between the SIM view and a GRAPH tab.
    - Graph tab plots metrics like creature count and traits. Press 'd' to
      choose which metric to display from a dropdown on the right.
    - The mini-map is toggled with 'm'.
