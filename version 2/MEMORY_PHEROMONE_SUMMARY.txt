Ecosystem Simulation â€“ Memory & Pheromone Systems Added

- **Memory System** (systems/memory.py):
  - Each Creature now has a Memory buffer (capacity 10) of recent events.
  - Memory events can be added and queried by type.

- **Pheromone Map** (systems/pheromone_map.py):
  - Global 2D pheromone grid tracks scent/intensity.
  - Creatures deposit 'presence' pheromones every tick.
  - Pheromones evaporate over time and can be queried.

- **Integration**:
  - World now instantiates PheromoneMap and evaporates each tick.
  - Creatures initialize Memory and deposit pheromones in their tick.
